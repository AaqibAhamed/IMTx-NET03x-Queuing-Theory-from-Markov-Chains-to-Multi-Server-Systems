# IMTx-NET03x-Queuing-Theory-from-Markov-Chains-to-Multi-Server-Systems
IMT Atlantique edX course Queuing Theory: from Markov Chains to Multi-Server Systems

## About this course
Situations where resources are shared among users appear in a wide variety of domains, from lines at stores and toll booths to queues in telecommunication networks. The management of these shared resources has direct consequences on users, through waiting times or blocking probabilities, just to name a couple of examples.

This MOOC on Queuing Theory will introduce the main mathematical tools that are necessary to anticipate the performance levels of queueing systems, and to understand the behavior of other systems that evolve randomly over time.

You'll learn how to describe a queuing system statistically, how to model the random evolution of queue lengths over time and calculate key performance indicators, such as an average delay or a loss probability.

Pratical coursework will be carried out using ipython notebooks on a Jupyterhub server which you will be given access to.

## By the end of this MOOC, you will be able to
Characterize a queue, based on probabilistic assumptions about arrivals and service times, number of servers, buffer size and service discipline
Describe the basics of discrete time and continuous time Markov chains
Model simple queuing systems, e.g. M/M/1 or M/M/C/C queues, as continuous time Markov chains
Compute key performance indicators, such as an average delay, a resource utilization rate, or a loss probability, in simple single-server or multi-server system
Design queuing simulations with the Python language to analyze how systems with limited resources distribute them between customers
